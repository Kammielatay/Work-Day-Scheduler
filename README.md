# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description:

Have you ever felt as though there wasn't enough time during the work day to get things done? 

If you are anything like me, than you know that planning out your work day is the best way to get things done. This work day planner will allow you to make a list of all the tasks that need to get done during the day with color coding time blocks to showcase what should be a priority for that hour.

### How to use: 

Simply just type in the task for that hour and click the save button. It is as easy as 1,2,3.

### Closing the application: 

 Need to close the application out and come back to it later? This application gives you the ability to close the tab and come back to it later with all the tasks during that day saved. No need to worry about losing your important information. 

### New day:

You are starting a new day and need the tasks erased? Don't worry! I took care of that for you already. When the clock strikes 11:59pm, the application will erase the content from the day and will allow you to start fresh for the day.
